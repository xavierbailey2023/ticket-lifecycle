Submitting tickets in osTicket as an end user to get help for various problems using.  Logging in to osTicket as a helpdesk member and seeing all the ticket requests that have been sent in.

Opening a ticket that was received as a supervisor and setting the Service Level Agreement(SLA) based on the severity of the issue. I then logged in as two other users to make notes that show that the ticket is being worked on.  Eventually the problem was resolved by the manager due to how important it was to get the ticket resolved quickly.
